Tour ten exceptional, beautifully photographed houses, and discover the details that make a Maine house a Maine house--from floors painted in glossy boat paint to artful displays of nature-walk finds. Also included: simple, seasonal DIY projects, like fragrant balsam pillows; tips from local shopkeepers, chefs, and makers on living the Maine way; a collection of Remodelista's thirty favorite Maine objects for the house (and porch); and design-centric itineraries for travelers planning a visit any time of year.

His mission: to empower Americans to have European trips that are fun, affordable, and culturally broadening. Rick produces a best-selling guidebook series, a public television series, and a public radio show, and organizes small-group tours that take over 30,000 travelers to Europe annually. He does all of this with the help of more than 100 well-traveled staff members at Rick Steves' Europe in Edmonds, WA (near Seattle). When not on the road, Rick is active in his church and with advocacy groups focused on economic and social justice, drug policy reform, and ending hunger. To recharge, Rick plays piano, relaxes at his family cabin in the Cascade Mountains, and spends time with his son Andy and daughter Jackie.

Frequent return visits led to his partnership with Rick, his work as a tour guide for Rick Steves' Europe, and co-authorship of this book. Pat, who loves all things Hibernian except black pudding, thrives on the adventures that occur as he slogs the bogs and drives the Irish back lanes (over 2,000 kilometers annually) in search of new discoveries."
