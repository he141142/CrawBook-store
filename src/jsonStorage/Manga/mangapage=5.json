        "about": "Naoki Urasawa's career as a manga artist spans more than twenty years and has firmly established him as one of the true manga masters of Japan. Born in Tokyo in 1960, Urasawa debuted with BETA! in 1983 and hasn't stopped his impressive output since. Well-versed in a variety of genres, Urasawa's oeuvre encompasses a multitude of different subjects, such as a romantic comedy (Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl), a suspenseful human drama about a former mercenary (Pineapple ARMY; story by Kazuya Kudo), a captivating psychological suspense story (Monster), a sci-fi adventure manga (20th Century Boys), and a modern reinterpretation of the work of the God of Manga, Osamu Tezuka (Pluto: Urasawa x Tezuka; co-authored with Takashi Nagasaki, supervised by Macoto Tezka, and with the cooperation of Tezuka Productions). Many of his books have spawned popular animated and live-action TV programs and films, and 2008 saw the theatrical release of the first of three live-action Japanese films based on 20th Century Boys. No stranger to accolades and awards, Urasawa received the 2011 and 2013 Eisner Award for Best U.S. Edition of International Material--Asia, and is a three-time recipient of the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award, a two-time recipient of the Osamu Tezuka Cultural Prize, and also received the Kodansha Manga Award. Urasawa has also become involved in the world of academia, and in 2008 accepted a guest teaching post at Nagoya Zokei University, where he teaches courses in, of course, manga."

        "about": "Konami Kanata was born on July 3, 1958, in Nagano, Japan. A veteran manga artist Konami made her professional debut in 1982 with the serialized comic Petit Cat Jam-Jam for Kodansha's semenal shoujo manga magazine NakaYoshi. The daughter of an elementary school teacher, most of Konami's stories are for readers of all ages making her one of the most accessible artists in recent history. In her nearly thirty year career, Konami has penned more than a dozen comic series, with the majority of them focusing on cats and pets. Konami is well regarded within the pet-manga community for her keen sense of cat ecology. Her ability to observe and render feline behavior has earned her respect from the Japanese manga community as a whole. While most of her properties were published for a younger female demographic, her most recent series Chi's Sweet Home is currently being published by Kodansha's Morning magazine, Japan's leading comic magazine for adult readers."
