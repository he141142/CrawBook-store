        "about": "Takashi Shiina debuted in 1989 with Shiina Department Store. His first ongoing series, Ghost Sweeper Mikami Gokuraku Daisakusen!! (Ghost Sweeper Mikami: The Great Paradise Battle!!), was a huge hit. His manga Psychic Squad ran until July 2021 in the magazine Weekly Shonen Sunday. His series Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon is serialized in Shonen Sunday Super. The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's prestigious New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Her recent notable works include Rin-ne and Mao. Takahashi was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Awards Hall of Fame in 2018. She won the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for Urusei Yatsura in 1981 and the second time for Inuyasha in 2002. A majority of the Takahashi canon has been adapted into other media, such as anime, live-action TV series, and film. Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon is set in the world of Takahashi's Inuyasha and continues the adventures of the original characters as well as their descendants."

In addition to Detective Conan, which won the Shogakukan Manga Award in 2001, Aoyama created the popular manga Yaiba, which won the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1992.

He originally intended to become a doctor and earned his degree before turning to what was then a medium for children. His many early masterpieces include the series known in the U.S. as Astro Boy. With his sweeping vision, deftly interwined plots, feel for the workings of power, and indefatigable commitment to human dignity, Tezuka elevated manga to an art form. The later Tezuka, when he authored Buddha, often had in mind the mature readership that manga gained in the sixties and that had only grown ever since. The Kurosawa of Japanese pop culture, Osamu Tezuka is a twentieth century classic."
